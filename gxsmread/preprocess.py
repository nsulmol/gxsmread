"""Pre-processing options to be performed on a gxsm file.

This file contains methods that can be performed on gxsm data
in order to help convert it to more 'understandable' data
(primarily, converting to physical units data).

We call it pre-processing because it will be bundled in a pre-
processing callable if called using xarray.open_mfdataset().

If using on it's own, you can simply feed an xarray.Dataset
to be corrected.

Note: these methods assume the provided dataset has been validated
as corresponding to a gxsm file!

    gxsm stores its recorded data in a 'FloatField' attribute, containing
    raw DAC counter data. In order to convert it to raw units, we must
    perform the following:
        data['raw'] = data['FloatField'] * data['dz']

    To convert it to physical units:
        data['physical'] = data['FloatField'] * data['dz'] * V_to_x_conversion

    where:
    - data['dz'] is the differential in 'z', correlating a DAC counter to
        a physical unit *within gxsm's understanding of the world*. Since the
        DAC data is received from one of the hardware device input channels
        (ADC#), this 'dz' is used to convert from the DC received voltage V
        to a unit x *without knowledge of the actual V-to-x conversion*. Thus,
        with the exception of the case of the topography channel, this is a
        'pseudo-unit'.
    - V_to_x_conversion is a conversion factor from this 'pseudo-unit' to
        physical units. Another way to think of this is that the 'pseudo-unit'
        considers V_to_x_conversion to be 1-to-1, and this is a correction of
        that (for the cases where the conversion is *not* 1-to-1).

    Args:
        ds: the Dataset instance we are to convert, assumed to be from a gxsm

        channel_config: a GxsmChannelConfig instance, holding the necessary
            info to convert and name our new data variable.

    Returns:
        A modified Dataset, where the 'FloatField' variable has been replaced
        by a variabled named after its channel, with physical units stored.

        Note: the channel name will either be taken directly from the gxsm file
        save format (e.g. topography files are saved with "Topo"), *or* with
        the desired channel name indicated in the config.
